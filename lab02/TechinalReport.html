            <h4>What is your element CSS class?</h4>
            <p>I have a class named "center", and I only want to change the font size of p tag in this class, so I only select p.center, change the font size of them.</p>

            <h4>What is your global CSS class?</h4>
            <p>I have a class named "center", and I added this class to all the text I want to center. Also, selecting the .class to choose all text to add text-align.</p>

            <h4>What are your HTML5-only tags?</h4>
            <p>I used two HTML5-only tags: header and audio. The header tag defines the header part of a document or part of a document. The audio can add music in the page.</p>

            <h4>What are your CSS3-only features?</h4>
            <p>I used two CSS3-only features: transition and opacity. The transition can add transition effects to any element and component. The opacity will make the elements fuzzy.</p>
